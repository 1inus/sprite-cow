Sprite Cow
==========

Sprite Cow helps you get the background-position, width and height of sprites within a spritesheet as a nice bit of copyable css.

Automated spritesheet generators are pretty cool, but I prefer the control over optimisation and compression you get by making them manually.

However, copying all the positions & sizes from graphics apps wasted a ton of my time, so I made this!
